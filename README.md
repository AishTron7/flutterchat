# flutterchat
A simple chat app programmed in dart, which has codebase for both android and iOS!

Some of the features implemented are: 
* scrollable message list
* animation while sending new messages
* Wrapping of the TextField widget in a Flexible widget. This tells the Row to automatically size the text field to use the remaining space that isn't used by the button.

**Note :** In order to run the app, clone this repository, open main.dart (This has the main code of the app) using VSCode or android studio (because only these two have flutter extensions), and finally press the run button. (You can use both android/iOS platform :smiley:)
