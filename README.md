# flutterchat
A simple chat app programmed in dart, which has codebase for both android and iOS!

Some of the features implemented are: 
* scrollable message list
* animation while sending new messages
* Wrapping of the TextField widget in a Flexible widget. This tells the Row to automatically size the text field to use the remaining space that isn't used by the button.
